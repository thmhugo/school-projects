    This report presents the work carried out on self-testing and nonlocality
    detection in the context of the \emph{Advanced Quantum Information Project}
    (PQIA). Nonlocality is studied through the prism of semi-definite
    programming - used herein for the numerical simulation and characterization
    of specific Bell scenarios - and its application to self-testing is
    examined. Particular attention is given to the retrieval of Bell
    inequalities, and a novel approach for the study of local and nonlocal
    behaviours using nonlinear optimization is described.
    % In this project report, we present our work on non-locality detection, mainly oriented towards
    % applied linear programming with Gurobi.
