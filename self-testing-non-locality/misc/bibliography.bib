  abstract = {Abstract
              The possibility of Bell inequality violations in quantum theory
              had a profound impact on our understanding of the correlations
              that can be shared by distant parties. Generalizing the concept of
              Bell nonlocality to networks leads to novel forms of correlations,
              the characterization of which is, however, challenging. Here, we
              investigate constraints on correlations in networks under the
              natural assumptions of no-signaling and independence of the
              sources. We consider the triangle network with binary outputs, and
              derive strong constraints on correlations even though the parties
              receive no input, i.e., each party performs a fixed measurement.
              We show that some of these constraints are tight, by constructing
              explicit local models (i.e. where sources distribute classical
              variables) that can saturate them. However, we also observe that
              other constraints can apparently not be saturated by local models,
              which opens the possibility of having nonlocal (but non-signaling)
              correlations in the triangle network with binary outputs.},

              a Tsirelson bound by maximizing over all no-signalling probability
              distributions. This maximization can be cast as a linear programme. In a
              setting where three parties, A, B and C, share an entangled quantum state of
              arbitrary dimension, we (i) bound the trade-off between AB's and AC's
              violation of the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt inequality and (ii) demonstrate
              that forcing B and C to be classically correlated prevents A and B from

	abstract = {Blind delegation protocols allow a client to delegate a computation to a server so that the server learns nothing about the input to the computation apart from its size. For the specific case of quantum computation we know that blind delegation protocols can achieve information-theoretic security. In this paper we prove, provided certain complexity-theoretic conjectures are true, that the power of information-theoretically secure blind delegation protocols for quantum computation (ITS-BQC protocols) is in a number of ways constrained. In the first part of our paper we provide some indication that ITS-BQC protocols for delegating \${\textbackslash}sf BQP\$ computations in which the client and the server interact only classically are unlikely to exist. We first show that having such a protocol with \$O(n{\textasciicircum}d)\$ bits of classical communication implies that \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{BQP\} {\textbackslash}subset {\textbackslash}mathsf\{MA/O(n{\textasciicircum}d)\}\$. We conjecture that this containment is unlikely by providing an oracle relative to which \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{BQP\} {\textbackslash}not{\textbackslash}subset {\textbackslash}mathsf\{MA/O(n{\textasciicircum}d)\}\$. We then show that if an ITS-BQC protocol exists with polynomial classical communication and which allows the client to delegate quantum sampling problems, then there exist non-uniform circuits of size \$2{\textasciicircum}\{n - {\textbackslash}mathsfΩ(n/log(n))\}\$, making polynomially-sized queries to an \${\textbackslash}sf NP{\textasciicircum}\{NP\}\$ oracle, for computing the permanent of an \$n {\textbackslash}times n\$ matrix. The second part of our paper concerns ITS-BQC protocols in which the client and the server engage in one round of quantum communication and then exchange polynomially many classical messages. First, we provide a complexity-theoretic upper bound on the types of functions that could be delegated in such a protocol, namely \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{QCMA/qpoly {\textbackslash}cap coQCMA/qpoly\}\$. Then, we show that having such a protocol for delegating \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{NP\}\$-hard functions implies \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{coNP{\textasciicircum}\{NP{\textasciicircum}\{NP\}\}\} {\textbackslash}subseteq {\textbackslash}mathsf\{NP{\textasciicircum}\{NP{\textasciicircum}\{PromiseQMA\}\}\}\$.},
