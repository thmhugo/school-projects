\begin{abstract}
    This report presents a review of a paper written by Apers and de Wolf
    \cite{apers_quantum_2019} in which a new quantum algorithm for graph
    sparsification relying on nearly linear classical algorithms is 
    introduced, leading to quantum speedups for several
    problems such as extremal cuts and Laplacian solving.
