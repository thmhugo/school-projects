\section{Introduction}

In this work, tall and thin matrices $\bs{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ with
$n = poly(d)$ are considered. This is the case for many types of matrices arising in
real world problems, such as the description of graphs or linear programs.

The objective is to compute an $\varepsilon$-spectral approximation of the
matrix, containing a much smaller number of rows: in this case $\tilde O(d/
\varepsilon^2)$ rows, as it has been shown by \citeauthor{st_sparsification}
(\cite{st_sparsification}).

The proofs are postponed to the end on purpose, for the sake of readability and
conciseness.

% The joint work is summarized in Sections 2, 3 and 4 -- my personal work report
% begins with Section 5.
